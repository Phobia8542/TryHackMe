# Notes taken from different sections of OWASP Top 10 Room on THM - https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop10
# The room is broken up into Severity levels from 1-10

Topics covered
#S1 Injections - OS command
#S2 Broken Authentication
#S3 Sensitive Data Exposure
#S4 XML Enternal Entitiy - DTD, XXE payloads & Exploitation
#S5 Broken Access Control - IDOR
#S6 Security Misconfiguration
#S7 XSS - Cross-site Scripting
#S8 Insecure Deserialization - Objects, Deserialization, Cookies & Code execution
#S9 Components With Known Vulnerabilities
#S10 Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

Broken Access Control - IDOR - Task 6 & 7
# Based on authorization users shouldn't be able to see certain pages/content
# Regular visitors shouldn't have access to protected pages/content
# Broken AC allows for - viewing of sensitive data & access to unauthorized functionality
# IDOR - Insecure Direct Object Reference - type of BAC vulnerability
# Can change user ID parameter - www.example.com/account_id=1234 > www.example.com/account_id=1235 - IDOR
XML External Entity - Task 12
# XML parser/data vulnerability
# Attacker can interact with backend / external systems - read files on system
# Can be used for DoS, SSRF, port scanning & RCE
# IB-XXE - In-band XXE - immediate response to XXE payload
# OOB-XXE - Out-of-band / blind - no immediate response / found in files on (their own) server 
XXE - Task 13
# XML - eXtensible Markup Language (defines rules for encoding documents - both human & machine-readable)
# XML - Non platform & Programming language specific (universally accepted)
# XML - Can be stored & moved without efforting data presentation - does not need to be converted
# XML - uses DTD & Schema validation to ensure document is syntax error free
# XML - <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> - XML prolog (good practice)
# XML - ROOT element references to "tags" used for syntax 
# XML - is case sensitive
XXE DTD - Task 14 
# DTD - Document Type Definition
# .dtd - extension
# Tags should be seen as "elements" - !ELEMENT !DOCTYPE !ENTITY
# #PCDATA - Parseable character data
XXE Payload - Task 15
# <!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY read SYSTEM 'file:///etc/passwd'>]> <root>&read;</root> - display /etc/passwd
# <!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY name "feast"> ]>
# <userInfo> <firstName>falcon</firstName> <lastName>&name;</lastName> </userInfo>
XXE Exploiting - Task 16
# Payloads should be URL encoded
