# Notes taken from the Meterpreter room on THM (3rd module in Metasploit series)

# Meterpreter runs on target system without being installed (runs in memory - not written to disk) - antivirus evasion
# Uses encrypted communication with servers to avoid IPS/IDS - TLS encryption
# Meterpreter is recognized by (major) antivirus software
# msfvenom --list payloads | grep payloads
# meterpreter works for different platforms (Operating systems & Programming languages)
# migrate session for (more) stable session - migrate <pid>
# Can escalate/lower user privilege by migrating session
Hashes
# Windows passwords are stored in SAM (Security Account Manager) database in NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager) format
# NTLM hashes ordinarily are very difficult to crack
# Pass-the-hash attack - NTLM hashes can be used on systems where the user has access
# Online NTLM databases & rainbow table attack
Post exploit
# getuid 
# getsystem
# get meterpreter pid: getpid 
# ps: spoolsv.exe (meterpreter ID)
# keyscan_start
# keyscan_stop
# keyscan_dump
# hashdump
# search
# shell - CTRL+Z to return to meterpreter
# load - python, kiwi, etc (use help after loading module)
Payloads:
Staged
# Send stager from attacker machine
# From target request the rest of the payload
# Allows for smaller payloads
Single
# Payload is sent and execute on target machine
Meterpreter version params
# Target Operating system - Linux, Windows, Android, etc
# Components available on target system - Python, PHP website, etc
# Network connection types - Allow raw TCP connections, reverse HTTPS conenction, IPv4 & IPv6
